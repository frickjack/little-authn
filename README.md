Open Id Connect client initially targeting AWS Cognito as an Identity Provider.

# Development

`gulp` manages the build and deploy process

* run build
  ```
  npx gulp compile
  ```
* watch for file changes, and build:
  ```
  npx gulp little-watch
  ```
* run local dev server
  ```
  npm start
  ```
, then http://localhost:3000/index.html has links to 
the component test pages at the bottom.
